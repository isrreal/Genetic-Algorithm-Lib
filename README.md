# Genetic-Algorithm-Library


## Concept

The metaheuristic known as the genetic algorithm seeks to deliver a near-optimal solution, inspired by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. The central idea is that, in a population, only the individuals best adapted to the environment will be able to pass their genes on through generations, subject to mutation rates and elitism, thereby ensuring the survival of the best individuals. This process is based on elements of nature, where reproduction, known as crossover, involves the intertwining of genes within the same population. The genes are composed of condensed filaments of DNA, called chromosomes, which represent sets of genes containing all the genetic information to be transmitted forward. The rates of elitism and mutation simulate the process of natural selection by generating individuals with more adapted genetic characteristics and subjecting these genes to changes caused by the environment.

Drawing a correlation with computational problems, the algorithmic approach considers the initial population as a set of initial solutions generated by some heuristic method, where each solution is represented by a chromosome, usually described as a vector of arbitrary length, and evaluated by a fitness function, which determines its suitability for use in the reproduction process, known as crossover. The crossover operator and the rates of mutation and elitism are mechanisms that allow the exploration and optimization of the set of solutions throughout the iterations of the genetic algorithm, which are defined by the number of generations.
